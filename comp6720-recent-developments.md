# Recent developments

My artwork reflects the recent developments in Art and Interaction Computing from the aspect of human and computer interaction. I focus on human-centred interaction and the audience's understanding of the interaction. I pay attention to the affordance of my design.

For interaction in my work, I try to make it as natural as possible to prompt the audience on how to interact. Combine the interaction with the audience's mind and subconscious. The main theme of my design is to express people's emotions and cognitions with my works and to inspire the audience to find more connections between themselves and the real world.
