# Artist Statement

## How would you would like viewers to perceive the major project theme in your work?
My work is about the dream “after hours". The first reason for choosing dreams to represent the theme "after hours" is that people are often tired and need to rest after work. 

It is also because "after hours" can also be interpreted as "after a few hours". We spend "hours" in our dreams (the perception of time in our dreams is changeable). The "universe” that connects the various dreams also indicates that the universe and time belong to the same huge and mysterious thing. The torrential rain in the universe not only adds to the strangeness of the dream world but also means that it is raining outside the window of the protagonist's real world.

The nail-painting scene combines tactile and visual perception. It is based on the inner desires of the protagonist.  The protagonist might suddenly want to decorate his nails during the day. And then, I put it into action in my “after-hours" dream, with rich colour changes and sound to create a stop-motion animation effect. It also shows the perverse shift of dreams.  Rich colours and exaggerated patterns express the repressed passion of the protagonist.

The combination of doughnuts and eyeballs links taste and visual perception. Based on the illogical and bizarre nature of dreams. From doughnuts based on the real world to weird and colourful eyeballs, they reflect the connection between people and the world to a certain extent. It calls on people to pay more attention to their own feelings and to find the interaction and connection between themselves and the world as an individual, to enlighten people to focus on the perceptual world.

## How does interaction enhance the viewer’s experience?
Through the keyboard and mouse, the audience can participate in the work. Rich colours and pictures attract the audience's interest and explore the purpose. The sound also makes the audience feel more immersed.
